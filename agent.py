My code works… I have no idea why.If it ain’t broke, improve it until it is.Automate everything.Keep your commits small and your dreams big.Error 404: Sleep not found.It works on my machine!Good documentation saves lives (or at least hours of frustration).Real programmers don’t comment—if it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.The best code is self-explanatory.Code never lies, comments sometimes do.Hello, world!ag
