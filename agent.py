There’s no such thing as a simple software project.Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.A programmer’s life: Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat.Code without purpose is just wasted keystrokes.Comment your code like you’ll never see it again.Merge conflicts are a way of life.The worst part of coding is explaining it to non-coders.Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.Your code is only as good as your last pull request.Trust the process, but verify the output.There is no cloud, just someone else’s computer.If code comments are longer than the code, you’re doing it wrong.Programming is 90% frustration, 10% eureka moments.Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.Syntax matters. Ask anyone who’s used Python.My code works… I have no idea why.If it ain’t broke, improve it until it is.Automate everything.Keep your commits small and your dreams big.Error 404: Sleep not found.It works on my machine!Good documentation saves lives (or at least hours of frustration).Real programmers don’t comment—if it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.The best code is self-explanatory.Code never lies, comments sometimes do.Hello, world!ag
